# 🌍 Country Data Fetcher

**Country Data Fetcher** is a simple JavaScript project that fetches data from a public countries API and displays country information in the form of cards. Along with the selected country, it also shows its **first neighboring country** to demonstrate how APIs and asynchronous JavaScript work together.

This project focuses on practicing **AJAX, Fetch API, Promises, and DOM manipulation** in a clean, visual way.
